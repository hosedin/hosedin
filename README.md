### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### My Story
* Hello! I'm X and currently a student in @Holberton School LILLE | PARIS | LAVAL ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·. I'd be finishing my studies in X months and I'm looking for an internship in WebDev | Blockchain | etcâ€¦". |  Iâ€™m very interested in game development and VR platforms.

* During my first year at Holberton, I worked mainly in C language, Python and bash scripting. Thus Iâ€™m comfortable with web development in Python with focus on unit testing and building MySQL Databases. 

* I recreated the printf function and Linux Shell with 2 different groups. Thanks to the school learning approach we learned to work collaboratively, in person and remotely.

### My Porfolio project
* For my portfolio project, I worked with a peer on a mobile application.
Itâ€™s an X.. application, built with swift and X..
We learned how to be organised to deliver a working MVC in a manner of a few weeksâ€¦
